# LSD
Digital Systems Laboratory Classes and Final Project using a FPGA (Field-programmable gate array) and VHDL language.

The classes and the final project are based in:

- Modelation, simulation and implementation of:
  - Arithmetic and combinatory circuits;
  - Registers and combinatorial shift modules;
  - Memories of a port and multi-port;
  - Finite state machines.

- Construction, use of testbenches and its simulation;
- Debugging circuits;
- Basic design precautions: reset, synchronization, generation and distribution of clock signals and time constraints.
